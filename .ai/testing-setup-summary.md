## 🔧 Key Features

### Unit Testing (Vitest)

- ✅ Global test environment with jsdom
- ✅ React Testing Library integration
- ✅ MSW for API mocking
- ✅ TypeScript support with proper types
- ✅ Coverage reporting with thresholds
- ✅ Mock utilities and helpers
- ✅ Test data factories

### E2E Testing (Playwright)

- ✅ Chromium browser configuration (as required)
- ✅ Page Object Model implementation
- ✅ Automatic dev server startup
- ✅ Screenshot and video capture on failure
- ✅ Trace collection for debugging
- ✅ Responsive testing capabilities
- ✅ Test data fixtures

### Testing Best Practices

- ✅ Separate unit and E2E test directories
- ✅ Mock factories for consistent test data
- ✅ Page Object Model for maintainable E2E tests
- ✅ Global test setup and teardown
- ✅ Type-safe testing utilities
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 📋 Verification Steps

To verify the setup is working correctly:

1. **Test Vitest Installation**:

   ```bash
   npm run test -- --version
   # Should show: 11.3.0
   ```

2. **Test Playwright Installation**:

   ```bash
   npx playwright --version
   # Should show: Version 1.54.2
   ```

3. **Run Sample Unit Test**:

   ```bash
   npm run test tests/unit/components/Button.test.tsx
   ```

4. **Run Sample E2E Test** (requires dev server):
   ```bash
   npm run dev &
   npm run test:e2e tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add Real Tests**: Replace example tests with actual component and feature tests
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Configure GitHub Actions to run tests automatically
3. **Coverage Thresholds**: Adjust coverage requirements based on project needs
4. **Performance Testing**: Consider adding Lighthouse audits
5. **Security Testing**: Add OWASP ZAP or similar security scanning

- `TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide with examples and best practices
- Inline code comments explaining configuration choices
- Example tests demonstrating proper patterns

## ⚠️ Notes

- The setup follows the tech stack requirements (Vitest + Playwright + Chromium only)
- All tests are configured to work with the existing Astro + React + TypeScript setup
- MSW is configured for API mocking in unit tests
- Playwright is configured for visual regression testing capabilities
- The setup includes proper TypeScript support throughout
